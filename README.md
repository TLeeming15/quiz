# <Javascript Quiz>

## Description

This is an online multiple choice quiz about Javascript. There is a bare minimum of HTML and CSS to provide some structure and style. The entirety of the actual use of the application is through Javascript. This was a challenging project for me and through it I have learned a great deal. The quiz is made a slightly competitive fashion and you are given a score upon completion. The score is the time remaining when you have answered all of the questions. If a question is answered incorrectly ten seconds are subtracted from the time
